By Brian Lee, Lilian Luong, and Srinath Mahankali

## Description
A comparison of the following models to predict static ASL sign language symbols:

Markup : * Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
         * The PCA Algorithm(Eigenface Algorithm) with Kernel SVM and MLPs
         * Stable PCP with Kernel SVMs and MLPs
         * DenseNet
